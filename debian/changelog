minecraft (2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refuse client access to everything except whitelist. This prevents it from
    harming server files, especially.
  * Suggest tmux because peristent servers are better.
  * Remove files before downloading. wget tries to avoid clobbering, which is
    the wrong thing always.
  * Apparmor pass through read request to CPU info and PCI uevent (cold plug?)
    events.
  * Add a application file and a icon.
